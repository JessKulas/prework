            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Where to begin... My name is Jessica Kulas. I got married in September 2021, three weeks later, my husband left for a year long deployment. This deployment is a first for the both of us and is now going to last over a year.
                We have two fur babies, Jax and Mia, they are true siblings. My husband will be bringing home another fur baby that he found on deployment. Prior to joining Coding Temple, I was a nurse. I have been a nurse for the last five and a half years. 
            I started working in telemtry/ICU step-down before moving to critical care a little over a year later. That is where my passion is. I started working on my nurse practioner, went to work in open heart surgery while still working in critcal care. 
        After making it through the program to clinical, I dropped the NP program, and I do not regret it for a second. After many crazy years in nursing, I decided to make a career change, which bring us to present day. </p>

                <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include, travel, going to the lake, hiking, biking, and kayaking. I also enjoy cooking and baking.</p>
